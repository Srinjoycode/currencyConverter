# currencyConverter
A currency Converter app developed in kotlin for the main 4 currencies used in the indian populace.
Smart Casting in kotlin has intelligently handled a lot of redundant casting for me.
Not having to specify the type of each variable explicitly ,even though kotlin is strongly typed has been a godsend in my android development projects and default arguments have made my code more concise, more expressive , much less redundant  and much more readable and maintainable
